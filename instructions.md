# Quick Start Guide for Alby Hub

1. **Configure Alby Hub**
   In the Alby Hub configuration settings, select your preferred Lightning implementation:

   - **LND on this server**: This option tells Alby Hub to use the LND node installed on this StartOS server. It is the more sovereign and secure option, allowing full control over your node.
   - **Alby Hub embedded light node**: This option tells Alby Hub to use its own, built-in light node. This option is convenient but offers less control over your node.

2. **Start the Service**
   After configuring, start the Alby Hub service.

3. **Launch Alby Hub**  
   Click the `Launch UI` button to open the Alby Hub interface.

4. **Get Started**  
   On the Alby Welcome screen, click the **Get Started** button. The button will display either (LND) or (LDK) based on your chosen configuration.

5. **Create a Strong Password**  
   Set a strong password for your Alby Hub account. It's recommended to store this password securely in your self-hosted Vaultwarden. If you are using the Alby Hub embedded light node, it is critical you do not lose your password, as it will result in loss of funds.

6. **Connect Your Alby Account**  
   Follow the on-screen instructions to connect your Alby account.

7. **All Set!**  
   You're done! Your Alby Hub is now ready to use.
