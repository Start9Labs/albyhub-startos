With an integrated node, it's more than just a walletâ€”it's your gateway to Bitcoin. Manage channels, run apps, and take charge of your funds, all through one sleek, user-friendly interface. Empower your Bitcoin journey with simplicity and sovereignty.
This repository creates the `s9pk` package that is installed to run `Alby Hub` on [StartOS](https://github.com/Start9Labs/start-os/).

## Dependencies

Prior to building the `albyhub` package, it's essential to configure your build environment for StartOS services. You can find instructions on how to set up the appropriate build environment in the [Developer Docs](https://docs.start9.com/latest/developer-docs/packaging).

- [docker-buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/)
